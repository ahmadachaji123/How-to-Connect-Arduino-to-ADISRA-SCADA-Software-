# How-to-Connect-Arduino-to-ADISRA-SCADA-Software-
This example shows how to connect ADISRA software to an Arduino using the Modbus serial protocol. No extra hardware is required, as we use the Modbus library on the Arduino. The same approach can be used to connect Arduino with other SCADA software.
